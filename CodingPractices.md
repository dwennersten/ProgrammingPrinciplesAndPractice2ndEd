# General Coding Practices Espoused Throughout the Book
- These notes start in chapter 4, although there were many suggestions up to this point
- Use descriptive constants in place of literals in code. 
- Write simple to understand expressions where possible, breaking larger expressions into smaller ones when seen useful for comprehension. 
- Always test your programs with "bad" intput! "A program should behave sensibly even if the users don't"
- "You don't demonstrate your cleverness by writing the most complex program.  Rather, you demonstrate competence by writing the simplest code that does the job." p.104
