## lvalue vs rvalue
- if int length = 99
    - length is an lvalue and is "the object named by length" 
    - So, lvalues are the boxes (objects, blocks in memory)
- if int area = length*width, length is an rvalue and is "the value of the object named by length"
    - so rvalues are the values held within the boxs (objects, blocks in memory)
